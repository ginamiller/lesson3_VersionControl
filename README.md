## Lessons Learned in the Assignment:
1. Version Control is a system that archives all changes made to a file, or group of files, over a period of time.
2. If you are a professional that would like to keep every version of an image, file or layout, it is highly recommended to use a Version Control System. A version control system can be local, centralized or distributed.
3. Git views its data like a series of snapshots of small filesystems.
4. There are two ways to get a Git project:
    a. Take an existing project and import into Git
    b. Clone an existing Git repository from another server
5. After you make changes to a file, you will have to commit snapshots of the changes to your repository each time you reach a state that you want to record.
